# On the Dot

[My Notes](notes.md)

A brief description of the application here.

> [!NOTE]
> This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.


## 🚀 Specification Deliverable

> [!NOTE]
> Fill in this sections as the submission artifact for this deliverable. You can refer to this [example](https://github.com/webprogramming260/startup-example/blob/main/README.md) for inspiration.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology
- [x] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

Have you ever wanted to improve your precision while having fun and competing with friends? "On the Dot" is a timing game where players stop a moving dot in a target zone to score points. Each successful hit shrinks the target or increases the speed, steadily raising the difficulty. Missing the zone ends the attempt after which the user can compare their score with others on the leaderboard.

### Design

### Key features

- Secure login over HTTPS
- Ring with dot and target zone clearly displayed
- Ability for user to stop the dot immediately
- High scores from all users displayed on leaderboard in live time

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Uses correct HTML structure for application. Five HTML pages for login, instructions, gameplay, post-game message, and the leaderboard.
- **CSS** - Application styling that looks good on different screen sizes, uses good whitespace, color choice and contrast.
- **React** - Implements the frontend logic of the application. React routing is used to switch between authentication, gameplay, and leaderboard views based on user actions and authentication state. React also manages game state, user input, and communication with backend service endpoints.
- **Service** - A backend service with endpoints for:
    - Registering, logging in, and logging out users
    - Submitting completed game scores
    - Retrieving leaderboard data
    - Retrieving user-specific statistics (such as best score or recent games)
    - Calling a third-party service ([http://colormind.io/api-access/](http://colormind.io/api-access/)) endpoint to retrieve a dynamically generated color palette used to style the game interface
- **DB/Login** - Store authentication information, users, and scores in database.
- **WebSocket** - As users finish, their scores are broadcast to all other users (if high enough for the leaderboard)
