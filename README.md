# Fact Flow

[My Notes](notes.md)

A brief description of the application here.

> [!NOTE]
> This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.


## 🚀 Specification Deliverable

> [!NOTE]
> Fill in this sections as the submission artifact for this deliverable. You can refer to this [example](https://github.com/webprogramming260/startup-example/blob/main/README.md) for inspiration.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology
- [x] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

Do you love trivia? Do you want to learn and have fun competing at the same time? "FactFlow" is a trivia application where players complete a daily trivia quiz and can compare their scores and time with users around the world. Instead of scrolling in your spare time, you can now be learning!

### Design

### Key features

- Secure login over HTTPS
- Same quiz for everyone
- New quiz daily
- Only one attempt per day
- High scores from all users displayed on leaderboard in live time
- Leaderboard refreshes daily

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Uses correct HTML structure for application. Four HTML pages for login, instructions, gameplay, and the leaderboard.
- **CSS** - Application styling that looks good on different screen sizes, uses good whitespace, color choice and contrast.
- **React** - Implements the frontend logic of the application. React routing is used to switch between authentication, gameplay, and leaderboard views based on user actions and authentication state. React also manages game state, user input, and communication with backend service endpoints.
- **Service** - A backend service with endpoints for:
    - Registering, logging in, and logging out users
    - Submitting completed game scores
    - Retrieving leaderboard data
    - Calling a third-party service endpoint ([https://opentdb.com/api_config.php](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php)) to retrieve random trivia questions
- **DB/Login** - Store authentication information, users, and scores in database.
- **WebSocket** - As users finish, their scores are broadcast to all other users (if high enough for the leaderboard)
